* tests
* compare to original source to make sure nothing is omitted
* edge cases:
  * Javascript newlines... preserve in case there are no semi-colons?
  * pre, block, etc... preserve newlines too?
* test the after_filter
* add a helper for Rack-based apps too
* seems to break on html docs without an xml decl. or doctype?
